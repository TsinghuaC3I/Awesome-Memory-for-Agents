## Overview

This repository provides a curated list of papers on agent memory, structured by a core taxonomy. We first divide agent memory based on its persistence:

- **Short-Term Memory:** Transient information managed within the context window for a single task;
- **Long-Term Memory:** Persistent information stored externally across tasks.

Within *Long-Term Memory*, we further distinguish based on its reliance on task outcomes (success/failure) for curation:

- **Experience** involves knowledge explicitly validated by task outcomes;
- **Memory** denotes information without reference to task outcomes.

This taxonomy maps directly to the three primary application scenarios that organize the papers in this repository:

| Application               | Memory Content                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personalization           | User profiles, interaction history, facts, etc.                          | Continuous personalized interaction, mainly targeting the conversation scenario and using an external memory pool with retrieval-based memory interaction |
| Learning from Experience  | Trajectories, success/failure lessons, reusable skills, etc.             | Cross-task experience accumulation & transfer                                                                                                             |
| Long-horizon Agentic Task | Intermediate results, reasoning traces, environmental observations, etc. | Context management within a single long-horizon task via summarization, reflection, or scratchpad, etc.                                                   |
